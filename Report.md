## Code Mentor Bot Report

I have developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that provides the following functionalities:

1. **Complexity Analysis**
2. **Code Conversion**
3. **Code Debugging**

#### Key Challenges

The most challenging task was selecting a suitable model for the project. The recommended models often proved to be inaccurate for the required tasks. I experimented with fine-tuning and training models, but the results did not meet the desired accuracy levels.
I emphasized on developing a backend as mentioned in the guidelines rather than focusing on frontend.

#### Model Selection

After extensive research, I opted for a model from Hugging Face:
- **Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct
- **Reason**: This model offers significantly better performance compared to recommended options, all while being under 1 GB in size.

#### Future Enhancements

I am eager to expand the project to include features such as:
1. **Skill Assessment**
2. **Interactive Monitoring**

However, I will be pausing further development temporarily to focus on my end-semester exams. Once the exams are over, I plan to resume work on these exciting features and provide updates.
